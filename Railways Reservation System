	For each reservation Confirmation Ticket will need to be made available in the screen with a Unique Ticket Number	
	Tickets can be reserved for only 1 user or many users meaning the Unique Ticket Number may be for 1 user or multiple users	
	Confirmed Ticket should be printable form kind of Date of travel, source, destination, time of start, reach time, number of stop overs - only count, name of the traverller(s), traver hours, reservation date/time	
	Ticket user should have identity proof in our End User data	
Cancellation Rules		
	From the train start date 7 days before if cancelled Refund 80%	
	From the train start date 4 days before if cancelled Refund 40%	
	From the train start date 2 day before if cancelled Refund 20%	
	On the day of train starts if the cancellation is done only 5% refund	
	Cancellation number will be generated - unique number - and should be allowed to print	
	Cancellation status should immediately reflect with respect to date/train, so that it should allow for other users to reserve/book the ticket	
	Cancellation Confirmation should be printable from with all the reservation information plus date of cancellation, reason for cancellation (need to capture this - it can be empty also) with the refund amount based on the cancellation rules	
"

Reports"		
At any point of time Admin users should be able to generate for any date/time/route the following reports		
	Travel Report	
	Reservation Report	
	Cancellation Report	
	End users who reserve should able to view last 3 months confirmed tickets/cancelled tickets/reserved tickets	
		
Technical Design/Architecture need to be derived for the following - Before start of the Development		
	Database Schema/Table Design	
	Presentation Layer - meaning UI Screens - for all the requirements stated above - none should be modified in the backend	
	Business/service Layer - based on the requirements create the functionality and have them in the middle layer	
	Database Layer - to access the DB data	
Validations		
	All front end validations need to be done	
	All business validations need to be properly reflected to the users with proper messages to change the data if needed	
	All database validations need to be properly reflected to the users with proper messages to change the data if needed	
Logs		
	To be maintained like which user using which functionality	
	App logs for each layer need to be differentiated	
		
Exclusions or Implicit Assumptions		
Payment gateway or payments are assumed that all goes well without invoking		
		
Implicit - Testing		
For all the development implicit usage of Unit testing code should be done		
		
Devops - Tools should be used		
Github, Maven, Jenkins must be used to build and deploy		
		
Notifications (optional)		
Sent through Emails and SMS		
		
Output Expected		
	Technology Stack going to be used	
	Architecture	
	Architecture flow	
	DB Design	
	Wireframe	
	Technical Requirements - LLD - Low Level Design Document	
	Test Cases	
	Code	
	RTM - Requirements Traceability Matrix
